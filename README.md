# artofcraftv2 
Discord x Picsart - PromoGenv2
This is v2 of the promogen. You can say its a zero day exploitation of api cause it doesn't need any captchas also the api doesn't validate the headers properly and the apis of picsart are poorly maintained which we took the advantage of to generate tons of promos.

Leaking cause i sold the program and some skid generating promos with it and saying it was made by them.
